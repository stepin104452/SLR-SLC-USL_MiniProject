# SLR-SLC-USL_MiniProject
These projects are designed for executing the following steps in machine learning: detailed EDA and data cleaning, detailed feature engineering and feature selection, multiple prediction modeling & optimization with model interpretation. 


My Learning : Stroke is a severe cerebrovascular disease caused by an interruption of blood flow from and to the brain. As a direct consequence of this interruption, the brain is not able to receive oxygen and nutrients for its correct functioning. The other way around, the brain is not able to drain and expel through blood vessels all of its waste, like dead cells. In a question of minutes, the brain is in a critical condition as brain cells will imminently begin to die. It is easy to understand that a patient with high glucose levels and BMI, who has suffered from heart disease and/or hypertension, is more likely to suffer from stroke. In this project, with the aid of machine learning (ML), several models are developed and evaluated to design a robust framework for the long-term risk prediction of stroke occurrence.
